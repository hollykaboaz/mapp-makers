Introduction

Due to the students' ability to abstain from being fully present in a classroom or an event, attendance data can be misleading. Students may attend class for the first five minutes and then leave for the remainder of the session, or be physically present but not mentally involved in the class session. There also have been situations where the recorded attendance data has been inaccessible to instructors when required, and other issues like difficulty managing multiple classes, pose serious problems. In educational institutions where attendance has been regarded as an important factor in taking cordial decisions such as awarding scholarships, there needs to exist a better method of recording attendance and quantifying the effects of class presence. To address such problems, the MAPP  attendance app is being proposed, the primary function of which is to track attendance. Additionally, the user will also be able to edit the data if needed. 
Furthermore, students added in a class will be able to track their own attendance, receive communication from their teachers, and view feedback constantly. The teachers can track and analyze student attendance throughout multiple classes, send communications, and receive feedback .
This student-led application development program will be nationally recognized for its abilities and potential revenue for the entire college and IT department. Student app developers will receive individual credits, class credits, and letters of recommendation as recognition for their expertise..
